# VolcanoSeason2
Based on the pseudo-app [VolcanoSeason](https://github.com/sweisss/VolcanoSeason), this app provides a no-frills list of links to weather forcast for mountains I frequently ski in the Spring.
It also incorporates the equipment checklist. 

This project is the result of self learning from YouTube and various online tutorials. 

After taking a formal class on mobile development, a new variation of this app is being developed in the [VolcanoSeason3](https://github.com/sweisss/VolcanoSeason3) repo.
