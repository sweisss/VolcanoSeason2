# VolcanoSeason2
Based on the pseudo-app VolcanoSeason (another repo on my account), this app provides a no-frills list of links to weather forcast for mountains I frequently ski in the Spring. It also incorporates the equipment checklist

The next step (when I eventally have the time to finish it) is to incorporate an add/remove feature to the links list and get the checklist to retain the checked status when the app is closed.
